# Sample Description:                          
Our website named *Tigerbook*. It is a part of social network like *Facebook*. You can post everything you like and comment everyone here. As a visitor, you can visit everyoneâ€™s page and browse other interesting news posted by administrators. But if you want to share your life, your moments, and make others know your ideas, you should register your own account, and you can find much more fun here. You do not like your nickname? Do not worry, you can change it no matter how many times you want, but reminder, the nickname is not unique. You may see others have the same nickname as yours, but no one will confound you guys, beacuse the username is unique. If you think your password is not safe anymore, you can change it to a more difficult one. The head sculpture is important for a social network account, you can upload different size picture. When you browse the news and find someone post really interesting things, you can add them to your friends, and you will never miss any moment. If you hear that someone posts so many interesting things, you can search the user name, and add that person to your friend list. 
* Browse as a visitor.
* Register as an unique user.
* Change the nickname and password.
* Change the head sculpture.
* Serach and add friends.
